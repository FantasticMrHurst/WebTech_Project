    <h2>WebTech Proposal (Tottenham Hotspur)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is your website about?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My website is going to be about the football team Tottenham Hotspur,
          basically acts as a fan page for the team, posting news, stats,
          information about the team and players
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>What is the objective of your website?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The objective of this website is to raise awareness and spread
          information about my favorite football team. This team is relatively
          less popular compared to other English teams so I want to contribute
          to increasing Spursâ€™ profile.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Who is your target audience set?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My target audience is mainly football fans, and more specifically
          Tottenham Hotspur fans that may want to update/learn more about the
          team.
